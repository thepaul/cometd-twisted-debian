cometd-twisted for Debian
-------------------------

This package is only meant to provide the cometd-twisted functionality and
allow you to run a daemon as needed for your case, not try to provide a one-
size-fits-all initscript and config.

To run it, use twistd as per normal (see twistd(1) for more information) with
/usr/share/cometd/twisted/cometd.tac.
